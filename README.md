 # NPM Scripts As Task Runner

- SCSS Compilation and Minification
- Post CSS and Autoprefixer
- BrowserSync

### Getting started

1. Download the zip file
2. Unzip the file and `cd` into the uncompressed folder
3. Run the following commend in your terminal: `npm install`

And you are ready to go! A new browser tab will open with hot reload on html and scss file saving.

Look the file `package.json` to see how it works and to freely expand it with all the NPM packages you want.
